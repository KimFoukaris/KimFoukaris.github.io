Why software development?  I keep asking myself the same question.  The simple answer is that I love it.

The whole story, though, is more complicated.  I’ve been fortunate enough to have had two interesting and opposite careers.  I started out as an environmental engineer, working to help communities and companies manage their resources.  Whether it was protecting groundwater so that residents had clean drinking water, preserving lakes that provided recreation and income generation for a region, or even cleaning up contaminated industrial sites as required by regulation, being an engineering consultant required technical expertise, project management skills, and the ability to communicate with clients and regulators.  I loved it and was proving quite good at it!

Life, of course, has a way of taking us in unanticipated directions.  After moving overseas for family reasons, I quickly found myself managing programs for the U.S. government as part of our foreign assistance program in Cyprus.  Fortunately, my engineering background had prepared me well.  Instead of solving environmental problems, I was working with partners to solve the social, economic and political problems they faced due to the division of the island.  I learned to think about problems from the perspectives of diplomats, scientists, economists, sociologists, educators and activists and was ultimately responsible for ensuring U.S. funding was spent responsibly.  It was both challenging and rewarding. 

Today, circumstances have changed again.  My family has grown up, the Cyprus program has narrowed, and  the time has come for me to move on.  So, why software development? I suppose I enjoy the challenge.  As I prepare for act three, I hope to combine my love for technical problem solving with my program management experience and my ability to see things from multiple perspectives.  I hope that Flatiron will be the perfect program to help me update my software development skills (it’s amazing how quickly things have changed over the last few years!) so that I can quickly start contributing in areas that I feel passionately about.  Whether it’s encouraging more young women to enter STEM careers or delivering services more effectively to the disadvantaged, there is no shortage of work to be done.  And I want to be part of it.
