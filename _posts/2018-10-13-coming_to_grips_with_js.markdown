I just wrapped up my Case Mangement Plus App and am going to take this opportunity to pat myself on the back for coming to grips with JS and APIs.  The assignment sounded simple:  add features to my existing RAILS MVC app using JQuery and a RAILS API to improve the user experience.  

I hit my first challenge almost immediately.  Given the design I had put in place during my Case Management project, adding dynamic features didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.  Why add dynamic features in the first place?  Which features would be best handled dynamically?  Could I provide options, depending on user preference?  There seemed to be a million questions I couldn't answer.

Next, I realized that though I could effectively use JS in a prescribed context, figuring out the best way to use it in a flexible environment was completely overwhelming.  It felt like there were a hundred ways to do everything and no clear answers on which way is best.  And I suppose that really is the power of JS : the possibilities are just about limitless.  For me, the answer was to take a timeout.  I reviewed, practiced and solved problems using a variety of techniques.    

I finally settled on a solution that kept the bulk of my Case Management project in tact.  Creating, editing and viewing my base features would remain MVC based.  I then added some additional dynamic features that would allow quicker case review and comment.  I suspect that this made the project more challenging than it needed to be, but as I went along this method provided me with opportunities to better understand my RAILS MVC and challenged me to understand my new dynamic features well enough to piece them together almost seamlessly.

I now feel confident and ready to move on to REACT and am hopeful that the time I've taken understand the interplay between RAILS and JS will pay off down the road.
