I have just finished my CLI Data App!  I can honestly say I enjoyed the experience, but I should also admit that there were times when I felt frustrated.  Maybe I made a mistake.  Perhaps this wasn’t for me.  So, what happened?  And what changed?

I started off feeling quite confident.  I had moved quickly through the first phase of the curriculum without any major challenges.  I was adjusting to object-oriented programming and gaining confidence after each minor setback.  Forewarned to keep it simple, I chose a realistic goal and got started.  

Because I love the idea of using data to solve social problems, I decided to scrape the University of Chicago’s Data Science for Good project page.  The structure was straightforward, and I figured the content would be interesting when I needed a break from nokogiri.  I had watched the Flatiron tutorials to help get me started and was ready to go.  Or so I thought.

With the training wheels off, the road suddenly looked terribly steep.  Git and GitHub were no longer automated by the Learn.ide.  I had to go back to basics and master them first.  Should I create an application or a gem?  What was the difference, really?  I’ll create a gem.  Why not challenge myself?  Great.  Now I’ve got the shell of a gem.  What does it all mean?  What’s the best way to require other gems?  I’ve seen it done so many ways?  OK.  At least I’ve got it working.  But now what.  Should I use a strategy like the one Avi demonstrated?  Sure.  Stub it out, get it working, improve it.  No, not so fast.  That doesn’t quite make sense to me yet.  I’ve created a big mess.  I better stick with a strategy that works for me.  Think it through and put a design plan on paper.  I can modify my methods down the road when object orientation is second nature.  What video capture software should I use?  Where should I post my narration?  The list of unknows just seemed to go on forever.  I felt paralyzed by uncertainty.  I procrastinated.  I avoided.  There was still so much I didn’t quite understand.  

Faced with the reality that I either had to quit or pull it together, I sat down with a new resolve.  Fast forward a couple of days (and what feels like a million google searches later!) and I’ve got a simple, but well put together Data Science Projects gem.  And I feel briefly like I’ve solved world hunger.  So, what is my lesson learned?  I can embrace the philosophy of “just give it a try”, while using my project management experience to keep me moving in the right direction.  It will continue to take practice (lots of it!), but I think it will be less intimidating the next time around.
